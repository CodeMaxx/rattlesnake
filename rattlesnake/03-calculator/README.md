# A Calculator

So, the coaching institute loved the software you built previously, and they want more applications built out of you. The physical chemistry professor feels that a lot of his class time is wasted in heavy calculations, wherein he can teach more concepts in that time. So he wants you to build a calculator. Here's the specification he has provided:

## Specifications
The calculator should have a text input field wherein you can input expressions. The professor has a touch screen computer, so he wants a buttons like a normal calculator. Numerical buttons, operand buttons, trigonometric functions, etc. He's a fast typer, so at times he uses the text input field to input expressions. The expressions can be of the form:

	(4 + 236)(456 - 234 ^ (sin(e + log(15))))

Since it's physical chemistry, physical constants are a must. There can be implicit multiplication (4 * 5 => (4)(5)). The input string can be parsed using a stack-like structure.
You decide what all features you want to have, take a look at a real calculator. For the UI, you can use anything - from Tkinter to PyGTK to PyQt, VTK, etc. Extra points to a beautiful looking UI.
