# A class of students

## Overview
We need an application for teachers to keep track of students and their grades.

## Details
Assume for now, there is a single teacher and a single class. Here's what you need to do.

1. Think of a way to store the student data in a file. You can use any format to store the data (JSON, CSV, XML etc)
2. A Student should have attributes (Name, PhoneNumber, Marks1, Marks2, Marks3)
3. Build a command line interface that does the following:
	
	* Read a student from the file
	* Add a student to the file
	* Edit a student's data

4. You can use any paradigm (beginners should stick to objects)
